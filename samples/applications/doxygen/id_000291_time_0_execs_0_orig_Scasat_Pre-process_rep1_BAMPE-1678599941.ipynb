    "We used `trimmomatic` to trim the adapter sequences. Paired-end reads were aligned to `hg19` using `BOWTIE2`. We used the `-X2000` parameter in `BOWTIE2` allowing fragments of up to 2 Kb to align. This considers that the read pairs within 2000 bp are concordant mapping. Duplicates were removed using `PICARD` tools `Markduplicate`. Reads are then filtered for alignment quality of >Q30 and were required to be properly paired. Reads mapping to the mitochondria, unmapped contigs and chromosome Y are not considered.\n",

    "### Removing the Blacklists\n",
    "Functional genomics experiments based on next-gen sequencing (e.g. ChIP-seq, MNase-seq, DNase-seq, FAIRE-seq) that measure biochemical activity of various elements in the genome often produce artifact signal in certain regions of the genome. It is important to keep track of and filter artifact regions that tend to show artificially high signal (excessive unstructured anomalous reads mapping). Below is a list of comprehensive empirical blacklists identified by the ENCODE and modENCODE consortia. Note that these blacklists were empirically derived from large compendia of data using a combination of automated heuristics and manual curation. These blacklists are applicable to functional genomic data based on short-read sequencing (20-100bp reads). These are not directly applicable to RNA-seq or any other transcriptome data types. The blacklisted regions typically appear u niquely mappable so simple mappability filters do not remove them. These regions are often found at specific types of repeats such as centromeres, telomeres and satellite repeats. It is especially important to remove these regions that computing measures of similarity such as Pearson correlation between genome-wide tracks that are especially affected by outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "One can download the `hg19 blacklist` into the data folder by `wget` [hg19 Blacklist](http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/encodeDCC/wgEncodeMapability/wgEncodeDacMapabilityConsensusExcludable.bed.gz)\n",

    "Perform peak calling and generate bedGraph using 50 bp reads centred on 5 prime cutting end, within a 50-bp smoothing window for bedGraph signal track. The parameters for macs2 are as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "- `-t/--treatment` FILENAME: This is the only REQUIRED parameter for MACS. File can be in any supported format specified by –format option. Check –format for detail. If you have more than one alignment files, you can specify them as `-t A B C`. MACS will pool up all these files together.\n",
    "- `-n/--name`: The name string of the experiment. MACS will use this string NAME to create output files like ‘NAME_peaks.xls’, ‘NAME_negative_peaks.xls’, ‘NAME_peaks.bed’ , ‘NAME_summits.bed’, ‘NAME_model.r’ and so on. So please avoid any confliction between these filenames and your existing files.\n",
    "- `-g/--gsize` <br><br> PLEASE assign this parameter to fit your needs! <br> <br> It’s the mappable genome size or effective genome size which is defined as the genome size which can be sequenced. Because of the repetitive features on the chromsomes, the actual mappable genome size will be smaller than the original size, about 90% or 70% of the genome size. The default hs – 2.7e9 is recommended for UCSC human hg18 assembly. Here are all precompiled parameters for effective genome size: <br> __hs__:\t2.7e9 <br> __mm__:\t1.87e9 <br> __ce__:\t9e7 <br> __dm__: 1.2e8\n",
    "- `-f/--format FORMAT`: Format of tag file, can be “ELAND”, “BED”, “ELANDMULTI”, “ELANDEXPORT”, “ELANDMULTIPET” (for pair-end tags), “SAM”, “BAM”, “BOWTIE” or “BAMPE”. Default is “AUTO” which will allow MACS to decide the format automatically. “AUTO” is also usefule when you combine different formats of files.\n",
    "- `--nomodel`: While on, MACS will bypass building the shifting model.\n",
    "- `--shift` : <br> Note, this is NOT the legacy –shiftsize option which is replaced by –extsize! You can set an arbitrary shift in bp here. Please Use discretion while setting it other than default value (0). When –nomodel is set, MACS will use this value to move cutting ends (5’) then apply –extsize from 5’ to 3’ direction to extend them to fragments. When this value is negative, ends will be moved toward 3’->5’ direction, otherwise 5’->3’ direction. Recommended to keep it as default 0 for ChIP-Seq datasets, or -1 * half of EXTSIZE together with –extsize option for detecting enriched cutting loci such as certain DNAseI-Seq datasets. Note, you can’t set values other than 0 if format is BAMPE for paired-end data. Default is 0. <br><br> Here are some examples for combining –shift and –extsize: <br><br>1. To find enriched cutting sites such as some DNAse-Seq datasets. In this case, all 5’ ends of sequenced reads should be extended in both direction to smooth the pileup signals. If the wanted smoothing window is 200bps, then use ‘–nomodel –shift -100 –extsize 200’.<br><br>2. For certain nucleosome-seq data, we need to pileup the centers of nucleosomes using a half-nucleosome size for wavelet analysis (e.g. NPS algorithm). Since the DNA wrapped on nucleosome is about 147bps, this option can be used: ‘–nomodel –shift 37 –extsize 73’.\n",
    "- `--extsize`: While ‘–nomodel’ is set, MACS uses this parameter to extend reads in 5’->3’ direction to fix-sized fragments. For example, if the size of binding region for your transcription factor is 200 bp, and you want to bypass the model building by MACS, this parameter can be set as 200. This option is only valid when –nomodel is set or when MACS fails to build model and –fix-bimodal is on.\n",
    "- `-B/--bdg`: If this flag is on, MACS will store the fragment pileup, control lambda, -log10(pvalue) and -log10(qvalue) scores in bedGraph files. The bedGraph files will be stored in current directory named NAME+’_treat_pileup.bdg’ for treatment data, NAME+’_control_lambda.bdg’ for local lambda values from control, NAME+’_treat_pvalue.bdg’ for Poisson pvalue scores (in -log10(pvalue) form), and NAME+’_treat_qvalue.bdg’ for q-value scores from Benjamini–Hochberg–Yekutieli procedure [False discovery rate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate#Dependent_tests).\n",
    "- `--SPMR`: Normalises the coverage plot values by millions of reads. \n",
    "- `--call-summits`: MACS will now reanalyze the shape of signal profile (p or q-score depending on cutoff setting) to deconvolve subpeaks within each peak called from general procedure. It’s highly recommended to detect adjacent binding events. While used, the output subpeaks of a big peak region will have the same peak boundaries, and different scores and peak summit positions.\n",
    "\n",
